## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**lamontsession/lamontsession** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on cloud security and DevOps/DevSecOps projects.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, and Terraform
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that I'm learning.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help from anyone willing to offer advice.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about all things cloud security or anything adjacent. 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: on Github or at lamontsession@outlook.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I still play 1st generation Yu-Gi-Oh and my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh game is Duelist of the Roses (the card game honestly should've been made that way to begin with lol).
